    "description": "The boundary between science and art often blurs, as both fields share similar techniques and can inform one another. A good example is the use of gradient filters, commonly seen in photo-editing software. These filters enhance contrast by highlighting areas of significant change, a method rooted in mathematics. Scientists also use gradient filters to reveal fine details in data that might otherwise be lost in noise. In solar research, this technique helps visualize coronal loops—massive arcs of solar material shaped by magnetic fields in the sun’s atmosphere. Studying these loops helps scientists better understand the sun’s magnetic activity, including powerful events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections.",

The image shows the sun end and spar of the ATM, with telescopes mounted on a perforated metal spar. The spar divided the ATM's cylindrical canister into four sections, fitting into a complex frame (rack) and was shielded by a solar cover.",

The SDO spacecraft was not so fortunate: its orbit only allowed it to observe a partial eclipse that at its peak covered only about 14 per cent of the sun (Aug. 21, 2017). Most of the people in the U.S. (weather permitting) observed at least 60 per cent coverage of the sun by the Moon. The good news for SDO is that it gets to see partial and solar eclipses several times a year. So, it all kind of balances out, in a way.\r\n",
