Cosmic light, presented in the colors of a lapis stone, seems to fill a gaping crater in space.\r\nNASA scientists, giddy to reveal the new image from the James Webb Space Telescope, beamed with delight. Here it is, they said: a dying star. It had sloughed its outermost layers, a seafoam of molecular hydrogen.",

    "description": "The boundary between science and art often blurs, as both fields share similar techniques and can inform one another. A good example is the use of gradient filters, commonly seen in photo-editing software. These filters enhance contrast by highlighting areas of significant change, a method rooted in mathematics. Scientists also use gradient filters to reveal fine details in data that might otherwise be lost in noise. In solar research, this technique helps visualize coronal loops—massive arcs of solar material shaped by magnetic fields in the sun’s atmosphere. Studying these loops helps scientists better understand the sun’s magnetic activity, including powerful events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections.",

It featured eight instruments to observe the Sun across a broad spectrum, from visible light to X-rays. The image shows the sun end and spar of the ATM, with telescopes mounted on a perforated metal spar. The spar divided the ATM's cylindrical canister into four sections, fitting into a complex frame (rack) and was shielded by a solar cover.",

This was the first of two missions named “Ready, Aim, PREFIRE” for NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment). The mission will last at least 10 months and aims to send two CubeSats into near-polar orbits to study how much heat Earth loses to space from the Arctic and Antarctica, helping to fill a gap in our understanding of this process.",

The ELaNa 19 payload included 10 CubeSats chosen through NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative. This launch marked the debut of NASA’s Venture Class Launch Services (VCLS), an innovative program managed by NASA’s Launch Services Program at Kennedy Space Center. VCLS was designed to provide small payloads with dedicated rides to space.",
